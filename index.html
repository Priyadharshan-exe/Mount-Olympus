            <p>In Greek mythology, Mount Olympus was the dwelling of the Olympian Gods and it was created after the Titanomachy, the battle during which the Olympians defeated their predecessors, the Titans, in a 10 year long war.The peak Mytikas was then called Pantheon and was the venue where all the fiery discussions among the deities took place.</p>

            <p>According to Homer's Odyssey, however, the peak never has storms and it basks in cloudless aithēr (Greek: “pure upper air”; thus “ether”). Later writers elaborated upon this description, which may have originated from the observation that the peak is often visible above a belt of relatively low clouds. There was also a place where the Throne of Zeus was located.</p>

                If equated with the modern day Mount Olympus found on the border of Thessaly, then the mountain itself had a god, an Ourea, associated with it, but in Greek mythology it is of course most famous for being the home of the Greek gods.
                 
                Mount Olympus first became home for Greek gods during the Titanomachy, when Zeus used it as his main stronghold when fighting the Titans, who themselves were based upon Mount Othrys.
                 
                After the end of the Titanomachy, Mount Olympus would be regarded as an acropolis, but the citadel would also be built up with palaces; palaces of marble and gold, constructed with bronze foundations, each of which was normally said to have been made by Hephaestus.  </p>
